## Problem Statement

After the revamp of the SAT examination in 2016, the participation rates in many US States is seen to be varied. In our analysis, we would be finding out which state would require more funding to improve their SAT participation rates. We would also back-up the decision with concrete evidence and what are the methods that can be used to improve the participation rate.  


## Executive Summary

Firstly, all the datasets for the standardized testing were cleaned, missing values were placed in, data entry errors were checked. Following the cleaning process, all the 4 datasets were compiled into one big dataset. The big dataset was grouped according to US states. Such grouping would help us to make state-level comparison for both the standardized tests. Next, we utilized masking techniques to analyze the data at a much more granular level to get a rough picture of the dataset. Masking the data is a form of filtering. Hence, masking allowed us to observe the data better. After we had done a rough analysis of the data, we moved to visualizing the data to get a deep understanding of the trends for both the exams. With a deep understanding of the data, we ventured on to state the trends that we had observed. We also did outside research to explain some of the trends that we observed to make a better decision. Lastly , we wrapped up the report by concluding the findings and recommended that the one state that should be chosen to receive the funding to increase the SAT participation.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

When deciding which state to choose, we would need to choose a state where the collegeboard organization has the potential to influence student's decisions. Therefore, we should be targeting a state where the students have the most flexibility. Many of the state level enforcements of standardized testing is geographically dependent as cited again from the prep-scholar article. These state level decisions are the most effective and equally challenging to compete against. Hence, a more optimistic short term solution would be to try and focus our attention on the states which do not have state level enforcement of the standardized testing. Therefore, the states in which we should be focusing on to improve SAT participation should have students that have an independent say on which exam they can take for their college applications.

Due to the above mentioned factors, we have chosen Oklahoma to be the state which will receive the funding to improve the SAT participation rate. Based on observations, Oklahoma's ACT participation dropped 100% to less than 50%. Moreover, during 2017 and 2018, Oklahoma had one of the lowest SAT participation rates. This probably suggests that Oklahoma used to have mandatory ACT testing. Therefore, the pre-college testing market is very volatile in Oklahoma and it also suggests that it has a lot of potential to increase the state's SAT participation significantly. These are the many reasons on why more efforts should be placed to increase the participation rates of SAT in Oklahoma, as not only do students have a choice, they are also offered full subsidies on both the SAT and the ACT exam. If more efforts are placed in the state, we would be able to observe higher positive impacts through the investment in that state. 
 

There are 2 main ways in which we would be able to increase the participation rate in Oklahoma. The first of which is to fund some form of training for the students. These training would allow the collegeboard to hone them with the skills required to ace the SATs. For instance, SAT bootcamps might be created to train students prior to the SAT exam in collaboration with the high-schools. These bootcamps would make the students feel more prepared for the SATs and more of them would be willing to attempt them. Moreover, many students fear the Math section in the SAT tests. Hence, we can also offer students more specific coaching during bootcamps with the assistance of high-schools to train them on the 'No calculator' SAT Math section. Ultimately, if the students are not forced to take any one of the possible 2 examinations, they would more likely to take the exam that they are more confident with. Without prior practice, the 'no calculator' section would seem very daunting and would push away any potential students from taking the SATs all together. Students choose things that they are used to.Therefore, giving prior proper training to students would be a good way to expose them to SAT type of questioning and to promote the SATs in a more subconscious level. 


The second method we could to deploy to increase participation rate in general would be to offer more test dates for SAT than the alternative standardized exam. The increase in the number of test dates will give more autonomy for the students on when they can take the SATs. When there are more test dates, students would be more appealed to the SATs. Such an implementation would be a regarded as a good testing ground before implementing to the other states if it's successful. Moreover, the test dates offered should accommodate the students schedule. Since, we are targeting states that don't enforce a standardized testing, these states would not be very accommodative of the test schedules. As seen in the SAT 2018 statistics, 38% of students have taken the exam in school hours which is 10% more than the previous year. Such an accommodative practice from the school has positively impacted the participation rates for SAT 2018 exams which can be seen through the higher overall participation in SAT 2018. Therefore, Collegeboard should look at collaborating with schools in the chosen states, such that it's easier for students to attempt the SAT examination as compared to alternative examinations.  


To conclude, we are highly confident that through having bootcamps to teach SAT skills and increasing the number of test dates, we can increase the SAT Participation rates in Oklahoma. The results are also more likely due to the certain conditions uniquely seen in Oklahoma. Another alternative to increase participation rates in Oklahoma would have been to provide certain subsidies for students such that they are more willing to take the SAT. However, such a drastic and costly measure need not be taken in Oklahoma as the state provides full subsidy of their pre-college exams. Which is also another positive reason why we had chosen Oklahoma as the Collegeboard does not need to spend a lot of money on this venture to increase participation of SAT. Hence, not only can we ensure a higher participation but we can also attain that with very low investments.
